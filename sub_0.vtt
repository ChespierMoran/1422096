WEBVTT

01:48.349 --> 01:50.869
Dude, you have to
pick up your phone!

01:52.181 --> 01:54.424
Todd?

01:54.528 --> 01:55.943
Oh, my...

01:56.046 --> 01:58.359
Okay, Todd. Uh...

01:58.463 --> 02:02.052
Uh, hi. Um, I need help.
I need an ambulance.

02:02.156 --> 02:04.365
My brother isn't breathing.

02:04.883 --> 02:07.920
Uh, no, no, he's not--
he's not responding.

02:08.024 --> 02:09.991
He's unconscious. I...

02:10.095 --> 02:11.683
I don't know. I don't know.
I just--

02:11.786 --> 02:13.995
I just found him like this.
Something is really wrong.

02:27.906 --> 02:29.632
Go get it. Go get it.

02:30.736 --> 02:32.393
Yeah. Fetch it up.

02:33.843 --> 02:36.156
What's up, man?
What are you looking at?

02:39.538 --> 02:44.440
Who's my bestest friend?
You? Is it you?

02:44.543 --> 02:46.994
You're so cute! I could die!

02:54.622 --> 02:56.693
Silly boy!

02:58.350 --> 03:01.146
Aww! You're so cute!

03:01.250 --> 03:03.217
What? Too scary for you?

03:03.321 --> 03:04.839
Indy! Come on!

03:04.943 --> 03:06.531
There's nothing there!

03:09.050 --> 03:10.569
Look who's here!

03:10.673 --> 03:13.986
Aww. There's my bestest friend.
Look at him. Look at him.

03:14.090 --> 03:15.850
Look at that big boy.

03:17.956 --> 03:20.372
Is that Papa?

03:20.476 --> 03:23.272
Who's that?

03:23.375 --> 03:25.412
He's free!

03:25.515 --> 03:29.933
Oh, the boys are back!

04:00.170 --> 04:02.276
Okay.

04:02.380 --> 04:06.246
Nope. Stay here, boy.
Stay. Sit.

04:07.143 --> 04:09.318
Good boy. Stay.

04:11.147 --> 04:12.493
Hey, sis. Question for you.

04:12.597 --> 04:14.184
<i>Todd, what the hell
is going on?</i>

04:14.288 --> 04:16.083
- Nothing.
<i>- I'm standing in your</i>

04:16.186 --> 04:17.395
<i>empty apartment right now.</i>

04:17.498 --> 04:19.155
Oh, yeah.
That's why I called.

04:19.259 --> 04:20.570
Um, I decided to
get out of town for a bit.

04:20.674 --> 04:23.504
Do you know where
Grandpa hid the gate key?

04:23.608 --> 04:25.713
<i>You're at Grandpa's?</i>

04:25.817 --> 04:27.128
Do you know where
he hid the key or not?

04:27.232 --> 04:28.854
<i>Are you out of your mind?!</i>

04:28.958 --> 04:31.098
<i>There is no way that
the doctor said this was okay!</i>

04:31.201 --> 04:32.789
They discharged me,
didn't they?

04:32.893 --> 04:34.998
<i>To go home, idiot!</i>

04:35.102 --> 04:37.138
<i>You can't just go wherever
the hell you want anymore!</i>

04:37.242 --> 04:39.106
They keys, Vera.
Where are the keys?

04:39.209 --> 04:41.108
<i>- Why Grandpa's?</i>
- Why not?

04:46.147 --> 04:49.323
Exactly. It's available.
I'm not bothering anybody.

04:49.427 --> 04:52.499
I needed a break.
This could be good for me.

05:03.751 --> 05:05.201
Found 'em!

05:05.305 --> 05:07.341
<i>Okay, I need you close
in case something goes wrong.</i>

05:07.445 --> 05:09.032
I gotta go.
Call me when you calm down.

05:09.136 --> 05:11.207
<i>Wait! Wait, wait!
Just tell me that you're oka--</i>

05:16.246 --> 05:18.387
Enough of that.

05:18.490 --> 05:20.837
Let's go.

05:46.794 --> 05:48.658
<i>There'll be a lot
of cleaning up to do</i>

05:48.762 --> 05:50.660
<i>because of the weather
over the next couple of days.</i>

05:50.764 --> 05:52.559
<i>It should help out
that at least Thursday</i>

05:52.662 --> 05:54.388
<i>and Friday will be dryer.</i>

05:54.492 --> 05:57.564
<i>More rain comes in
on Friday night...</i>

07:03.181 --> 07:05.217
Come on, bud. Let's go.

07:06.702 --> 07:08.462
Come on, scaredy pants.

07:10.326 --> 07:11.948
It's not that bad.

07:13.191 --> 07:14.572
Come on, buddy.

07:15.642 --> 07:18.610
You coming out or not?

07:22.200 --> 07:26.273
There we go! Okay.

07:26.376 --> 07:28.931
This way. Come on.

08:24.124 --> 08:25.988
Come on, bud.

08:29.232 --> 08:31.027
Okay.

08:31.131 --> 08:32.132
Welcome home.

08:33.651 --> 08:34.997
I know!

08:35.100 --> 08:37.793
But it beats the hospital, right?

08:44.524 --> 08:46.249
Wait here.

09:53.213 --> 09:54.973
Ohh! Man!

10:11.024 --> 10:12.473
Okay.

10:12.577 --> 10:14.544
Ohh! Yes.

10:21.862 --> 10:24.485
Something smells awful
down here.

10:24.589 --> 10:26.902
Glad I don't have <i>your</i> nose.

10:28.524 --> 10:30.319
Come on, bud.

10:36.290 --> 10:38.810
<i>So, how long have you
been planning this?</i>

10:38.914 --> 10:42.849
Planning? No planning.
It wasn't some big thing, Vera.

10:42.952 --> 10:44.609
<i>- The red light's on.</i>
- I just needed to go.

10:44.713 --> 10:46.818
<i>Hm. No. Yeah.
That totally makes sense.</i>

10:46.922 --> 10:50.580
<i>The cursed family house
is a great place to relax.</i>

10:50.684 --> 10:53.204
It's not really
how I remember it.

10:53.307 --> 10:54.930
<i>Oh, yeah. Creepier?</i>

10:55.033 --> 10:56.725
Not exactly. It's just...

10:56.828 --> 10:58.692
You think "house in the woods"
sounds so peaceful.

10:58.796 --> 11:00.832
Wait. Is that Indy?

11:00.936 --> 11:02.627
No. Old home movie.

11:02.731 --> 11:04.318
Grandpa's playing fetch
with Bandit.

11:04.422 --> 11:05.457
You remember that dog?

11:05.561 --> 11:06.976
<i>Uh, kinda.</i>

11:07.080 --> 11:09.047
<i>But didn't Grandpa
just have a ton of dogs?</i>

11:09.151 --> 11:11.671
Yeah, but they all
just kept running away.

11:11.774 --> 11:13.638
Indy, on the other hand,
never leaves my side.

11:13.742 --> 11:15.398
I can't poop without a witness.

11:15.502 --> 11:18.056
<i>Eww! Don't tell me that.
I don't need to know that.</i>

11:19.817 --> 11:22.026
Grandpa had a ton
of these VHS tapes.

11:22.129 --> 11:25.823
Mostly this
and shitty horror films.

11:25.926 --> 11:28.239
I think he was taping over them.

11:28.342 --> 11:30.690
<i>What's the point
of making a home
movie if you live alone?</i>

11:30.793 --> 11:32.899
No idea.

11:33.002 --> 11:34.728
<i>Can you tell there's
something wrong with him?</i>

11:34.832 --> 11:36.696
Wrong with who?

11:36.799 --> 11:39.008
<i>With Grandpa. On the tape.</i>

11:39.112 --> 11:42.391
Not at all. He seems happy.

11:43.116 --> 11:46.222
<i>Well, that's how Grandpa's
generation did it, you know?</i>

11:46.326 --> 11:47.914
<i>Put on a happy face,</i>

11:48.017 --> 11:50.951
<i>even when you're rotting
from the inside out, right?</i>

11:52.608 --> 11:54.714
<i>I guess living in a haunted
house takes your mind off it.</i>

11:54.817 --> 11:56.819
The house
isn't haunted, Vera.

11:56.923 --> 11:59.304
<i>Oh, yeah? No one has
lived there for more
than a few weeks.</i>

11:59.408 --> 12:02.722
- Grandpa did.
<i>- Yeah, and it killed him.</i>

12:04.862 --> 12:07.588
<i>Look, uh...
you just have to promise me</i>

12:07.692 --> 12:09.487
<i>that at the first sign
of relapse,</i>

12:09.590 --> 12:12.766
<i>you're gonna get in that car
and you are coming back.</i>

12:12.870 --> 12:14.975
Okay. Sure.
But the rehab promised me...

12:18.496 --> 12:20.015
<i>Okay.</i>

13:43.650 --> 13:45.617
God damn it!

14:30.248 --> 14:31.353
Hey, man.

14:33.044 --> 14:35.391
What's going on?

14:44.021 --> 14:46.195
Alright. Let's go.

14:46.299 --> 14:47.887
Come on.

14:49.164 --> 14:51.545
Come on. Come on.

16:07.897 --> 16:09.520
What?

16:12.281 --> 16:14.490
Yeah. I know. It's creepy.

16:14.594 --> 16:17.148
It's all my family
buried under here.

16:17.252 --> 16:18.874
Come on.

16:23.292 --> 16:25.743
They all died pretty young, too.

16:33.302 --> 16:36.443
Whoa. Stay here, boy.

17:39.196 --> 17:40.749
Here, boy.

17:44.477 --> 17:46.927
What the hell
are you doing out here?

17:47.031 --> 17:48.791
Uh, excuse me?

17:48.895 --> 17:51.277
You should be more careful.

17:51.380 --> 17:53.279
It's fox huntin' season.

17:53.382 --> 17:56.489
I've got traps and snares
all over these woods.

17:56.592 --> 17:59.492
Is that Mr. Downs?

17:59.595 --> 18:01.839
Good to see you all grown up.

18:01.942 --> 18:06.050
How long will you be staying
with us out here in the boonies?

18:06.154 --> 18:08.328
Well, indefinitely.
I gave up my old place.

18:08.432 --> 18:10.089
Taking over Grandpa's.

18:10.192 --> 18:11.400
You staying in that place?

18:11.504 --> 18:13.368
- Yeah. What?
- Nothing.

18:13.471 --> 18:16.060
I just pray for you
after everything,

18:16.164 --> 18:18.062
the way your grandpa died.

18:18.166 --> 18:19.684
Well, we're gonna
make it our own.

18:19.788 --> 18:22.549
Just gotta clear it out,
get the electric going.

18:22.653 --> 18:25.276
I got an old generator
if you need it.

18:25.380 --> 18:28.797
I'm just down the hill.
Come by any time you need help.

18:30.143 --> 18:33.457
Your grandpa was out here
with his dog, too.

18:35.562 --> 18:39.635
After we found his body,
we never did find that dog.

18:45.572 --> 18:47.367
Am I crazy?

18:47.471 --> 18:49.576
It's nice here, right?

18:51.130 --> 18:53.511
Right?

18:53.615 --> 18:56.445
Indy? Right?

19:01.864 --> 19:03.694
Yeah. You get it.

19:05.834 --> 19:07.353
Alright.

19:09.493 --> 19:12.012
You're sure you know
how to set this up?

19:12.116 --> 19:14.049
Electric for old houses
is pretty tough.

19:14.153 --> 19:16.603
Yeah. I got it.
Thank you, though.

19:16.707 --> 19:17.984
Okay.

19:18.087 --> 19:19.227
Just make sure
you get it running

19:19.330 --> 19:20.814
before this weather rolls in.

19:20.918 --> 19:22.540
Not really safe when it's wet.

19:22.644 --> 19:25.267
Yeah. No problem.
Have a good night.

19:26.613 --> 19:28.684
Take care!

19:36.520 --> 19:38.315
<i>Just out of curiosity,</i>

19:38.418 --> 19:41.318
<i>have you noticed Indy
acting weird lately?</i>

19:41.421 --> 19:43.216
What do you mean?

19:43.320 --> 19:45.391
<i>Weird-weird.</i>

19:45.494 --> 19:48.221
<i>Like staring at nothing
or sniffing for something
he can't find.</i>

19:48.325 --> 19:51.500
- One more time. Vera...
<i>- This is serious. Okay?</i>

19:51.604 --> 19:53.399
<i>You're the one
that keeps telling me</i>

19:53.502 --> 19:57.023
<i>that he won't leave you alone,
so I went online and...</i>

19:57.126 --> 19:59.128
<i>Does it seem like
he's searching for something</i>

19:59.232 --> 20:01.890
<i>that you can't see or
something that doesn't exist?</i>

20:01.993 --> 20:03.340
Oh, you mean being a dog?

20:03.443 --> 20:05.134
Trust me.
There's nothing wrong with Indy.

20:05.238 --> 20:07.033
<i>Todd, I'm not worried there's
something wrong with Indy.</i>

20:07.136 --> 20:09.138
<i>I'm worried there's
something wrong with you.</i>

20:09.242 --> 20:12.556
<i>Okay? They-- They use dogs to
detect all kinds of stuff now.</i>

20:12.659 --> 20:15.214
Oh, yeah. I'm aware.
Like bombs, cocaine.

20:15.317 --> 20:17.699
<i>Yeah, or, like,
medical problems.</i>

20:17.802 --> 20:20.426
Hey. Uh...

20:20.529 --> 20:23.912
Okay. Seriously.
<i>Dogs' noses are very sensitive.</i>

20:24.015 --> 20:26.673
- Ah. Jesus Christ.
<i>- They can detect all kinds
of stuff that tests miss.</i>

20:26.777 --> 20:28.848
<i>And doctors have
even been using dogs--</i>

20:56.979 --> 20:58.533
Fuck.

21:16.861 --> 21:19.347
Hey!

21:19.450 --> 21:21.383
Knock it off!

21:29.564 --> 21:31.669
There's nothing out there.

21:33.084 --> 21:34.983
None of that, please. Okay?

21:35.086 --> 21:39.643
Come on.
You silly goose. Huh?

21:39.746 --> 21:41.472
Come on.

21:43.163 --> 21:47.961
<i>For countless centuries,
mankind dwelled in the dark.</i>

21:48.065 --> 21:50.101
<i>But he wasn't alone.</i>

21:53.829 --> 21:55.659
<i>In caves all over the Earth,</i>

21:55.762 --> 21:58.178
<i>we see evidence of
the most successful partnership</i>

21:58.282 --> 22:01.768
<i>between any two species
on the planet.</i>

22:01.872 --> 22:04.081
<i>With keener senses
than their human partners,</i>

22:04.184 --> 22:07.774
<i>dogs protected cave dwellers
from unseen dangers</i>

22:07.878 --> 22:12.400
<i>and alerted them
to the presence of predators.</i>

22:12.503 --> 22:15.610
<i>Mankind has left the caves,</i>

22:15.713 --> 22:18.198
<i>but the darkness
haunts us still.</i>

22:26.483 --> 22:29.831
Oh. Can I help you?

22:29.934 --> 22:31.350
You want some?

22:31.453 --> 22:34.422
<i>...companions yield
to this primordial doom.</i>

22:39.081 --> 22:40.807
Pretty good.

22:40.911 --> 22:43.051
Hm...

24:53.388 --> 24:55.252
Not so fast, boy.
Come around here.

24:55.355 --> 24:57.703
Yeah, yeah, yeah,
yeah, yeah, yeah.

24:57.806 --> 24:59.394
How's my boy doing?

24:59.498 --> 25:01.914
Big, strong guy.

25:02.017 --> 25:03.916
Hey, buddy, buddy,
buddy, buddy, buddy.

25:04.019 --> 25:07.057
Who's a handsome man?
A big, handsome man!

25:07.160 --> 25:09.611
Come on. Ooh! Hey.

25:11.233 --> 25:13.063
Good. Good boy.

25:14.271 --> 25:16.756
What? What's your problem?

25:22.244 --> 25:26.663
Hey. Bud. Leave that alone.
Come on, Indy.

25:26.766 --> 25:28.216
Come on. It's breakfast time.

25:29.562 --> 25:32.461
Indy! Breakfast!

25:37.121 --> 25:38.675
Okay. Sit.

25:40.331 --> 25:41.919
Good.

25:45.164 --> 25:50.479
Alright, Indy. You good?
Guard the house.

30:48.847 --> 30:50.883
Not now, buddy.

30:50.987 --> 30:53.644
Can you just go
lay down somewhere?

30:58.787 --> 31:00.548
I said not now.

31:35.755 --> 31:38.103
I said not now, bud.

31:40.553 --> 31:43.591
I said give me a minute.

31:49.942 --> 31:52.358
I said get the fuck out of here!

36:03.954 --> 36:05.473
Quiet!

36:06.819 --> 36:07.958
Stay.

36:22.076 --> 36:25.321
Go on. Back upstairs.

36:49.552 --> 36:54.108
<i>Okay. Where was I? Uh...</i>

36:54.212 --> 36:56.593
<i>All the taxidermy</i>

36:56.697 --> 36:59.838
<i>I leave to my daughter,
the vegan.</i>

37:01.253 --> 37:05.637
<i>And, uh,
to my grandson, Todd...</i>

37:07.397 --> 37:08.778
<i>Everything else.</i>

37:08.881 --> 37:11.367
<i>Six generations...</i>

37:11.470 --> 37:13.610
<i>of one family
have lived in this place.</i>

37:14.887 --> 37:17.752
<i>Lived and died.</i>

37:23.379 --> 37:26.209
<i>I guess I'm next.</i>

37:26.313 --> 37:27.969
<i>I should never have come here.</i>

37:28.073 --> 37:31.594
<i>Are you still up for me
coming out this weekend?</i>

37:31.697 --> 37:33.941
When did we decide on that?

37:34.044 --> 37:36.254
<i>Oh. Well, you know,
I just thought that
it could be really--</i>

37:36.357 --> 37:37.496
You thought what?

37:37.600 --> 37:38.773
<i>I thought
that it would be nice.</i>

37:38.877 --> 37:41.535
You want to check in on me.

37:41.638 --> 37:43.468
<i>Well, isn't that
what sisters do?</i>

37:43.571 --> 37:45.401
<i>I just want to help.</i>

37:45.504 --> 37:47.195
Can you not?

37:47.299 --> 37:48.956
<i>I-I'm not trying to nag you.
I just...</i>

37:49.059 --> 37:51.303
<i>I really just want to
make sure that you're okay.</i>

37:51.407 --> 37:53.650
- You are so full of it.
<i>- What?</i>

37:53.754 --> 37:56.619
Can I have one day where
I don't have to be a patient?

37:56.722 --> 37:59.173
Can you help me with that?
<i>- I'm not trying to make you--</i>

37:59.277 --> 38:01.417
Because whenever you call--
and you call all the time--

38:01.520 --> 38:03.557
I'm just sitting here
dreading and waiting

38:03.660 --> 38:05.352
for you to feel like
we've chatted enough

38:05.455 --> 38:07.768
that you can ask one
of your inane questions.

38:07.871 --> 38:09.839
You know what?
Maybe this would be helpful.

38:09.942 --> 38:11.668
Let me save you
the trouble of asking

38:11.772 --> 38:13.187
on your next ten phone calls.

38:13.291 --> 38:14.706
I'm fine. I'm feeling fine.

38:14.809 --> 38:17.122
Nothing's wrong.
And I'm staying.

38:17.225 --> 38:18.986
<i>Well, alright...</i>

38:19.089 --> 38:20.712
No, you're not sorry. Shut up.

38:20.815 --> 38:23.301
That's what I want. Shut up.

38:23.404 --> 38:24.888
Let's make a new rule.
Until I come to you

38:24.992 --> 38:27.305
with some kind of crisis,
you just lay off.

38:27.408 --> 38:29.030
Think you can handle that?

38:30.825 --> 38:31.757
<i>Yeah.</i>

38:31.861 --> 38:34.450
Great...

39:56.117 --> 39:57.705
Run!

40:49.239 --> 40:50.793
Indy?

40:54.797 --> 40:56.246
Indy?

40:56.350 --> 40:58.076
Where you at?

40:58.179 --> 40:59.664
Indy?

40:59.767 --> 41:01.907
Come on.

41:04.254 --> 41:05.773
Indy!

41:12.677 --> 41:15.127
Indy? You down here, boy?

41:20.339 --> 41:21.893
Hello?

41:39.151 --> 41:40.532
Indy?

41:42.327 --> 41:44.881
How did you...

41:44.985 --> 41:46.780
What the hell?

41:50.404 --> 41:53.545
Come on, Houdini.

42:02.278 --> 42:03.521
Okay. Hold still, bud.

42:05.523 --> 42:07.283
It's almost over.

42:14.048 --> 42:17.673
Oh, you smell like death.

42:42.663 --> 42:46.253
No. No, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no.

43:02.372 --> 43:05.030
I'm sorry. It's just too late.

43:05.134 --> 43:06.722
What do you mean?

43:06.825 --> 43:09.897
Maybe if you had come in
earlier, before it progressed.

43:10.001 --> 43:12.762
So you're rejecting me
because I'm too sick?

43:12.866 --> 43:14.868
Clinical trials have
strict entry requirements.

43:14.971 --> 43:16.732
That's bullshit.

43:16.835 --> 43:18.803
You don't even treat half
the people you say you will.

43:18.906 --> 43:21.357
And if it works on me,
it'll definitely work, right?

43:21.460 --> 43:22.979
Why are you trying
to reject someone

43:23.083 --> 43:25.154
that wants to be
your guinea pig?

43:25.257 --> 43:28.260
I'm sorry.
It just doesn't work like that.

43:28.364 --> 43:30.124
God damn it!

43:58.083 --> 44:01.052
What are you
doing there, Todd?

44:01.155 --> 44:03.295
Nothing! Nothing.

44:04.538 --> 44:06.920
Uh, wait. Actually...

44:07.023 --> 44:09.232
Do you know if any hyssop
grows around here?

44:09.336 --> 44:12.926
Honeysuckle root.
I'm collecting those things.

44:13.029 --> 44:15.238
No. Sorry.
Never heard of them.

44:15.342 --> 44:19.173
All good. All good.
I'll figure it out.

44:19.277 --> 44:21.797
Well, figure it out over there
'cause you're getting

44:21.900 --> 44:25.041
pretty close to where
I placed those fox traps.

44:26.180 --> 44:29.183
You take care of yourself, son!

44:29.287 --> 44:31.254
Be careful out here, boy.

44:37.675 --> 44:39.746
Okay.

44:41.023 --> 44:43.232
Coming through. Okay.

44:47.408 --> 44:48.686
Now we focus.

44:50.722 --> 44:52.310
That's perfect.

44:56.452 --> 44:58.937
To the northwest corner.

45:08.464 --> 45:11.260
And that-- that's it.

46:57.262 --> 46:59.540
What are you looking at, boy?

47:05.719 --> 47:07.652
It's alright.

47:07.755 --> 47:10.068
Just the wind outside.

47:10.172 --> 47:11.380
Sleep.

47:26.015 --> 47:27.845
Sorry, bud.

47:28.846 --> 47:30.848
Not tonight.

50:44.110 --> 50:45.801
Hello?!

50:51.531 --> 50:53.084
Hello?

50:56.605 --> 50:58.124
It's okay, boy.

51:05.096 --> 51:07.581
Shh.

51:24.081 --> 51:26.186
God damn it!

51:26.945 --> 51:29.603
No! You stay there!

51:35.022 --> 51:35.954
Fuck.

54:53.876 --> 54:55.326
Stay.

55:17.314 --> 55:19.592
I told you to stay.

56:27.970 --> 56:29.386
No.

56:48.991 --> 56:50.407
Stay here.

01:04:05.565 --> 01:04:07.464
Who's there?

01:05:31.099 --> 01:05:33.481
Indy.

01:05:33.584 --> 01:05:36.587
Ohh. I'm so sorry, boy.

01:05:47.667 --> 01:05:49.946
How did you get back here?

01:05:53.708 --> 01:05:55.434
Come on.

01:05:58.851 --> 01:06:02.096
Come here. Come here.

01:06:02.199 --> 01:06:04.098
What's going on?

01:06:04.201 --> 01:06:06.997
What's wrong? What's wrong?

01:06:08.965 --> 01:06:11.519
What happened?

01:06:11.622 --> 01:06:15.316
How did you do this?
How did you get up here?

01:06:15.419 --> 01:06:17.214
Huh?

01:08:47.123 --> 01:08:49.401
You're a good dog.

01:08:50.850 --> 01:08:52.473
No.

01:08:59.031 --> 01:09:02.241
Boy, you can't save me.

01:09:03.863 --> 01:09:06.659
You gotta stay here.

01:10:43.100 --> 01:10:45.344
Oh, God.

01:10:56.252 --> 01:10:58.668
Hey!

01:11:00.704 --> 01:11:02.913
Hey!

01:11:05.295 --> 01:11:07.193
Okay. Come on., Indy. Let's go.

01:11:11.508 --> 01:11:13.545
Come on, Indy.
